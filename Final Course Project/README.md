# Make Something Fun

The idea of the project is to create a game of our own, demonstrating what we have learned during the course

This includes

* user interactivity
* lightning
* space-orientation
* applying textures

**NOTE:** ! This homework has to be setup w/ Apache in order for the textures to be applied correctly
